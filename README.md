# IntrinsicAI

In a digital era brimming with information, the quest for knowledge can often feel overwhelming and impersonal. Traditional learning platforms typically overlook a vital component of deep learning — intrinsic motivation. IntrinsicAI is born out of the recognition that the most profound learning occurs when individuals are driven by their passions and interests. This platform is not just another educational tool; it's a bridge connecting learners with their aspirations, enabling them to learn by doing something they truly care about.

## Overview

IntrinsicAI harnesses the power of Generative AI to curate personalized, project-based learning experiences. By combining a user's project idea with the technical realms of HTML and CSS, we create a unique learning pathway for each user. This pathway is tailored to guide learners to the successful completion of their project, ensuring that the process remains engaging and motivation stays high.

### How It Works

1. **Submit Your Project Idea:** Users start by sharing what they're passionate about building.
2. **Feasibility Assessment:** Our platform evaluates if the idea can come to life using HTML and CSS.
3. **Personalized Learning Pathway:** Once approved, a custom course outline and targeted tutorials are provided.
4. **Project Suggestions:** If the idea is not immediately feasible, alternative projects aligned with the user's vision are suggested.
5. **Build and Learn:** Learners engage with the material while actively working on their projects.

Given the hackathon's time constraints, we've focused IntrinsicAI on HTML and CSS. However, our MVP demonstrates scalability, with the potential to expand into various topics and subject areas.
