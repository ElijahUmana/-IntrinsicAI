Tutorial: Introduction to HTML for Creating the Backbone of a College Hackathon Website

In this tutorial, we will introduce the basics of HTML, focusing on understanding the fundamental tags, elements, and structure. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a solid grasp of how HTML is used to create the backbone of a web page for a college hackathon website.

What is HTML?
HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure the content of a web page. It uses a system of tags to define the structure and elements within a webpage.

The Basic HTML Structure
Every HTML document begins with a specific structure:

html
Copy code
&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt
&lthtml&gt
  &lthead&gt
    &lttitle&gtYour Title Here&lt/title&gt
  &lt/head&gt
  &ltbody&gt
    &lt!-- Your content goes here --&gt
  &lt/body&gt
&lt/html&gt
Now, let's break down each part of this structure:

&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt: This declaration tells the web browser that the document is written in HTML5, the latest version of HTML. It should be the very first line in your HTML document.

&lthtml&gt: The &lthtml&gt element serves as the root of your web page. All other elements are nested inside it.

&lthead&gt: The &lthead&gt element contains meta-information about the document, such as the page title, character set, and links to external resources like CSS and JavaScript files.

&lttitle&gt: The &lttitle&gt element sets the title of your web page, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab. It's also essential for search engine optimization (SEO).

&ltbody&gt: The &ltbody&gt element contains the main content of your web page. This is where you place text, images, links, and other visible elements that users will see.

Basic HTML Elements
HTML uses a variety of elements (also called tags) to structure content. Here are some common ones you'll use in creating the backbone of your college hackathon website:

&lth1&gt, &lth2&gt, &lth3&gt, &lth4&gt, &lth5&gt, &lth6&gt: These elements define headings with different levels of importance, from the main title (&lth1&gt) to subsection headings (&lth2&gt, &lth3&gt, etc.).

&ltp&gt: The paragraph element is used to structure text content. It separates text into paragraphs.

&ltul&gt and &ltol&gt: These elements are for creating unordered and ordered lists, respectively. Use &ltli&gt (list item) inside them to define individual list items.

&lta&gt: The anchor element is used for creating hyperlinks. It allows you to link to other web pages or resources.

&ltimg&gt: Use the image element to display images on your web page. You'll need to specify the source (src) attribute to point to the image file.

&ltdiv&gt: The division element is a generic container for grouping content. It's often used for layout and styling purposes.

Creating the Backbone of Your Hackathon Website
Now that you've learned about the basic HTML structure and elements, let's start creating the backbone of your college hackathon website. Begin with the following steps:

Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text).

Create an HTML file and save it with a &quot.html&quot extension (e.g., &quotindex.html&quot).

Begin with the HTML structure mentioned earlier and replace &quotYour Title Here&quot with the actual title of your hackathon website.

Inside the &ltbody&gt element, start adding content such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and images to represent the structure of your webpage.

As you add content, save the file and open it in a web browser to see how your webpage is shaping up.

Congratulations! You've taken your first steps into the world of HTML, creating the foundational structure for your college hackathon website. In the next tutorials, we'll delve deeper into adding content, styling with CSS, and creating additional pages for your project.
